# Textutile - React Text Utility

## Project Overview

Textutile is a web application built using React that provides various text manipulation and analysis features. With Textutile, you can easily perform tasks like converting text to uppercase or lowercase, enabling dark mode for comfortable reading, counting words, and even having the text spoken out loud. Additionally, Textutile uses React Router for seamless navigation between different sections of the application.

## Features

### 1. Dark Mode

Switching to dark mode provides a visually appealing and comfortable reading experience in low-light conditions. This feature enhances the usability of the application, ensuring readability and reducing eye strain.

### 2. Uppercase and Lowercase Conversion

Textutile allows you to quickly convert text between uppercase and lowercase. This feature is handy for adjusting the text case to meet your specific needs.

### 3. Speak Text

With the "Speak" feature, Textutile utilizes text-to-speech technology to read aloud the provided text. This is particularly useful for proofreading, language learners, or individuals with visual impairments.

### 4. Word Count

The "Word Count" feature enables you to analyze the text and get an accurate count of the words within it. This can be valuable for various purposes, such as tracking document length or meeting word count requirements.

### 5. React Router Integration

Textutile is built using React Router, which allows for seamless navigation between different sections of the application. This integration ensures a smooth user experience by enabling direct access to specific features through URLs.
